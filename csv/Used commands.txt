The query that was used to query the RepoReaper dataset with LogParser:

logparser -i:CSV -o:CSV "SELECT repository,language,architecture,community,continuous_integration,documentation,history,issues,license,size,unit_test,stars,scorebased_org,randomforest_org,scorebased_utl,randomforest_utl INTO cpprepos_org.csv FROM dataset.csv WHERE language = 'C++' AND randomforest_org = 1"

The file was split with these instructions in to files of 100 entries:

To download the repositories this command was used, where filename is substituted for the name one of the split files:
for f in `cat <filename>.csv`; do `git clone https://github.com/$f`; done
