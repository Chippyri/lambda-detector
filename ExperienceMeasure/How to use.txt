1. Place devexp.sh one level above the directory which contains all repositories. 
2. Run. A file called experience.txt will be created. It will contain commaseparated information about each repository.

Improvements needed:
Add repository owner to commaseparated .txt-file.
The path for the file should be relative.
There is unnecessary code present and so much printing is not necessary.
Some values can be moved outside functions.
